## Our reproducibility toolkit

### `R` + `RStudio`

#### Why `R`?
- Programming language for data analysis:
  - Free!
  - Open source
  - Widely used and supported across all disciplines
  - Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux!

#### Why not language X?
- There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis

- The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate and document your analysis

- Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another

#### Once in `R`

You could just type into the command prompt...
 - ... but that doesn't help much with documentation.
 - ... but that doesn't help much with automation.

#### A better solution
- With `RStudio` you can combine your programming and your documentation.
- RStudio gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your analysis - It runs on top of `R` - Gives you a bunch of really cool features that we'll explore throughout the workshop.

## R Packages

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable `R` functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and (often) sample data. (From: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)

- We will use the `ggplot2` package for plots and `dplyr` for data wrangling in this session. Both packages come as part of the `tidyverse` suite of packages. 

- If you have not yet done so, install this package by running the following in the Console:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
````

## Demo

Goals of the demo:

- Demonstrate "good practice" for organizing data files and analysis documents (`RMarkdown`)
- How to read data from a file
- How to manipulate the data, and document it in a reproducible way
- How easy it would be to revert any changes if need be
- How to subset data
- How to make simple plots in ggplot
- **NOT** about understanding all the `R` commands, but  **rather** getting the big picture of how using `R` in this way facilitates reproducible analyses

### R Markdown demo

Open `intro-template.Rmd`

Click on `Knit HTML` to compile the document

Important features:

- YAML on top
- Code in chunks
- `RMarkdown` syntax
    - Human readable!
    - Limited, so not too time consuming to master
- Self contained workspace

### Extending the analysis

Great news!? We just received some more data, in bits and pieces of course:
`gapminder-7080.csv`

`gapminder-90plus.csv`

Let's walk through generation of new plots for the 1970s and 1980s and 1990s plus (these new analyses are already in the `intro-tutorial.Rmd` document).

Note that all code required to accomplish these tasks is also in the template. You do not need to come up with the R code, **knit** the document to combine the datasets and you'll see that the code required for recreating the plots is the same as above. That's the beauty of `RMarkdown`!

### Take aways
- The analysis is self-documenting
- It's easy to extend or refine analyses by copying and modifying code blocks
- The results of the analysis can be disseminated by sending `RMarkdown` and providing data sources, or just simply providing the generated HTML of just a summary of the analysis is needed

> ## Reproducibility checklist
>
> - Serves as a tool to help you think about the reproducibility of your data analysis.
> - Many of the questions can be thought of as having a yes/no answer.
> - A better approach would be to see the questions as being open ended with the real question being, "What can I do to improve the status of my project on this bullet point?"
> - With that in mind, you'll never get 100% of the bullets right for your project, but you'll always be improving.
